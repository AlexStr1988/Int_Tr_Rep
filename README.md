## Stata do-files for getting the results

## Step 1
Identify a convinient directory on your laptop and put all related files from GitHub to it.

## Step 2
Open **1. Table 2 replication.do** and update the directory pathways for input and output files. This file includes a Stata code which will replicate Table 2 from the paper. A **PDLresults.xlsx** file will appear as an output of the code, and it will be further used in the Stata file for replication Table 3 from the paper.

## Step 3
